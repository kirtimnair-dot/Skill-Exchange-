        <p>How the Local Skill Exchange Platform Works

Our platform is designed to make skill sharing simple, safe, and accessible for everyone in the community.

1. Sign Up & Create a Profile
Create your account using a secure login and build a profile that highlights your interests and skills. You can choose to offer skills, learn new ones, or both.

2. Discover or List Skills
Browse a wide range of skills offered by community members or list your own skills for others to find. Set your availability, pricing (or offer free sessions), and preferences.

3. Connect & Communicate
Use the built-in chat system to communicate securely with other users, discuss requirements, and finalize session details.

4. Book & Learn
Schedule sessions at convenient times and start learning or teaching. After sessions, leave reviews to help maintain trust within the community.
